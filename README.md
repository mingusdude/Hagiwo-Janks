# Hagiwo-Janks
My humble takes and adjustments of Hagiwo, and those who follow his bloopy gospel

***   This is my first actual repository I've published, so forgive my vieuxness so to speak,I'll figure it out... Right?   ***

Big giant shout out to Hagiwo. Your output is insane(in the best possible way), and the entire Synth DIY community is in your debt.

Furthermore Huge thanks to Todbot, you continuously bring all of us fun things to bleep and bloop along with,
and that is just really rad. This would NOT have happened, without your board, and the sensible way you 
present your code!

Lastly, Mzuelch! Again, crazy output. Love your stuff. Just a quick pin change(2 to 3) and these will work 
with your VCO board too .

Okay, Lets get down to business

Here, for your bleeping pleasure, are an assortment of oscillators for use with Hagiwo's(via @todbot's pcb design)
Nano powered VCO design. Here we have...

* 2 Operator FM * (switched pin 3 to 2 to mirror schematic)
* Additive CoSine/Sine * (Super Smooth version of original, using Todbot's version as template)
* Additive Triangle * (Crunchitized version of original, using Todbot's version as template)
* Chord * (switched pin 3 to 2 to mirror schematic)
* Additive Saw * (Not sure that's right here, maybe Folding? Fractal? Splintering)

-2 OpFM and Chord, are both just variations on code pulled from mzuelch
-CoSine/Sine and Triangle were logical progressions from the previous work, and a whole bunch of variations are left to find.
-The Saw oscillator was a HUGE surprise for me. Not only did it sound WAY better than I ever imagined; it also ran well with
 all 8 oscillators, which was a problem with some versions before.
 
Hope you like em. Let me Know!
